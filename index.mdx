Aqua is a liquidity optimization protocol built on MegaETH, designed to help users grow their positions efficiently. It offers automated vaults that rebalance between diffrent DEXs liquidity pools based on real-time yield performance.

The core product is the**Liquidity Position Auto-Balancer** , which allows users to deposit assets into smart vaults that rotate funds between LPs according to APR. Users receive ERC20 staking receipts that represent their share in the vault and grow in value as yields are compounded.
